/*
5.a Create an array of Students (the class created in Task 3) with 10 elements in it. Each student must have a unique name.

5.b Create a function that takes in the array from 5.a as a parameter as well as an integer. The function should return the field "name" (the name of the student) and print it. Call this method with different parameters (only the integer - not the array) from the setup() of Datamatik.

5.c Create a similar function to that of 5.b, but instead of receiving the array and an integer, it receives the array and a string. Loop through all elements in the array until you find the element with the name received as a parameter. Then return the index of that student. Call this method with different names from the setup() of Datamatik
